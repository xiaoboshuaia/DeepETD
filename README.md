# DeepETD
## Metabolites participate in almost all the fundamental biological processes in vivo. Accumulating new phenotypes of classic metabolites have been revealed; yet the underlying targets and mechanisms remain to be elucidated. 
## Here, we develop a bioinformation and attention mechanism-based deep learning model called DeepETD leveraging abundant bioinformation of metabolites for functional target prediction of specific phenotypes.
